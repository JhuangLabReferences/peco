notes
=====

+ To do: Add @importFrom statements as needed.

+ To do: Remove all "imports" comments.

+ To do: Remove unneeded Imports in DESCRIPTION.

+ Please fix: I don't understand the description of the eset_final_sub
  data set. What are "theta" and "exprs(est_final)"?

+ Please fix: The "fit" data set should be a single object; currently
  it loads two objects, "fit_predict" and "fit_train". Maybe define a
  list with two elements. Also, I suggest using a more descriptive
  name.

+ Please fix: Why do "fit_bspline" and "fit_loess" return a list with
  only one element? You don't need the list.

+ Please fix: some undocumented arguments that should be added to the
  roxygen2 docs:
  - Undocumented arguments in cycle_npreg_insample: ‘...’
  - Undocumented arguments in cycle_npreg_loglik: grids, method.type,
    method.grid ‘...’
  - Undocumented arguments in cycle_npreg_mstep: method.trend, polyorder,
    ncores, ‘...’
  - Undocumented arguments in cycle_npreg_outsample: ‘...’
  - Undocumented arguments in initialize_grids: ‘...’
  - Undocumented arguments in run_seurat: s.genes, g2m.genes, n.bin,
    seed.use, random.seed

+ Suggestion: In the file circle_npreg.R, the functions are
  "cycle_npreg_*". Maybe hange the name of the file to be consistent.

+ Suggestion: Explain in "Description" field of DESCRIPTION file why
  it is called "peco". (And in README.)

+ Suggestion: If reasonable to do so, reduce size of data sets in
  "data" folder in order to reduce installation time from GitHub.

+ Suggestion: Create a "release" on GitHub. (I can show you how.)

+ Suggestion: Add titles to roxygen docs for data sets.

+ Suggestion: Create a pkgdown site, and activate GitHub Pages (see
  https://github.com/stephenslab/mixsqp for an example of this). This
  is easy to do once you have create the vignettes and roxygen2 docs
  for your R functions.
