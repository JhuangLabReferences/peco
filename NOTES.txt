notes
=====

+ To do: Remove all "imports" statements.

+ To do: Remove unneeded Imports in DESCRIPTION.

+ To do: Test loading data sets.

+ To do: Figure what are "theta" and "exprs(est_final)" are
  data(eset_final_sub).
  
+ Why do "fit_bspline" and "fit_loess" return a list with only one
  element? You don't need the list.

+ Suggestion: Explain in "Description" field of DESCRIPTION file why
  it is called "peco". (And in README.)

+ Suggestion: If reasonable to do so, reduce size of data sets in
  "data" folder in order to reduce installation time from GitHub.

+ Suggestion: Create a "release" on GitHub. (I can show you how.)

+ Suggestion: Add titles to roxygen docs for data sets.

+ Suggestion: For the "fit" data set, I suggest using a more
  descriptive name.

+ Suggestion: Create a pkgdown site, and activate GitHub Pages (see
  stephenslab/mixsqp for an example of this). This is easy to do once
  you have create the vignettes and roxygen2 docs for your R
  functions.

+ Some undocumented arguments that should be added to the roxygen2 docs:
  - Undocumented arguments in cycle_npreg_insample: ‘...’
  - Undocumented arguments in cycle_npreg_loglik: grids, method.type,
    method.grid ‘...’
  - Undocumented arguments in cycle_npreg_mstep: method.trend, polyorder,
    ncores, ‘...’
  - Undocumented arguments in cycle_npreg_outsample: ‘...’
  - Undocumented arguments in initialize_grids: ‘...’
  - Undocumented arguments in run_seurat: s.genes, g2m.genes, n.bin,
    seed.use, random.seed
