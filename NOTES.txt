notes
=====

+ To do: Remove all "imports" statements.

+ Why do "fit_bspline" and "fit_loess" return a list with only one
  element? You don't need the list.

+ Suggestion: Explain in Description why it is called "peco".

+ Suggestion: If reasonable to do so, reduce size of data sets in
  "data" folder in order to reduce installation time from GitHub.

+ Suggestion: Create a "release" on GitHub. (I can show you how.)

+ Suggestion: Add titles to roxygen docs for data sets.

+ Suggestion: For the "fit" data set, I suggest using a more
  descriptive name.

+ Suggestion: Create a pkgdown site, and activate GitHub Pages (see
  stephenslab/mixsqp for an example of this). This is easy to do once
  you have create the vignettes and roxygen2 docs for your R
  functions.
