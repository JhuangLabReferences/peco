Description: A supervised approach for **P**r**e**dicting **c**ell cycle
    pr**o**gression using scRNA-seq data. We also provide training data
    which includes scRNA-seq data collected from 6 individual cell lines 
    of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and also continuous cell 
    cycle phase derived from FUCCI fluorescence imaging data. Our approach 
    allows to identify cyclic trend of gene expression levels along the 
    cell cycle phase.
