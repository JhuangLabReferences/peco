Description: A supervised approach for **P**r**e**dicting **c**ell cycle
    pr**o**gression in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using
    scRNA-seq data. We provide gene-specific estimates of cyclic
    trends of gene expression based on our training data. These
    gene-specific estimates can be applied to other scRNA-seq data to
    predict cell cycle phases (measured as angles on a unit
    cirlce). The training data consists of fluorescence imaging data
    and scRNA-seq data from iPSCs derived from 6 Yoruba cell lines.
