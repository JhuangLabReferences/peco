Description: A supervised approach for predicting cell cycle progression in induced 
    pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using scRNA-seq data. We provide gene-specific 
    estimates of cyclic trends of gene expression based on our training data. These
    gene-specific estimates can be applied to other scRNA-seq data to predict cell 
    cycle phases (measured as angles on a unit cirlce). The training data consists of
    fluorescence imaging data and scRNA-seq data from iPSCs derived from 6 Yoruba
    cell lines.
